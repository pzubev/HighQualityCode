###Intent
- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to client subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
- Base class declares algorithm 'placeholders', and derived classes implement the placeholders

###Problem
Two different components have significant similarities, but demonstrate no reuse of common interface or implementation. If a change common to both components becomes necessary, duplicate effort must be expended

###Discussion
The component designer decides which steps of an algorithm are invariant (or standard), and which are variant (or customizable). The invariant steps are implemented in an abstract base class, while the variant steps are either given a default implementation, or no implementation at all. The variant steps represent "hooks", or "placeholders", that can, or must, be supplied by the component's client in a concrete derived class.

The component designer mandates the required steps of an algorithm, and the ordering of the steps, but allows the component client to extend or replace some number of these steps.

Template Method is used prominently in frameworks. Each framework implements the invariant pieces of a domain's architecture, and defines "placeholders" for all necessary or interesting client customization options. In so doing, the framework becomes the "center of the universe", and the client customizations are simply "the third rock from the sun". This inverted control structure has been affectionately labelled "the Hollywood principle" - "don't call us, we'll call you"

###Structure
Template Method scheme

![alt tag](https://github.com/pzubev/HighQualityCode/blob/master/Template_Method_-2x.png)

The implementation of template_method() is: call step_one(), call step_two(), and call step_three().  step_two() is a "hook" method â€“ a placeholder. It is declared in the base class, and then defined in derived classes. Frameworks (large scale reuse infrastructures) use Template Method a lot. All reusable code is defined in the framework's base classes, and then clients of the framework are free to define customizations by creating derived classes as needed.

###Template Method in Code

```c#
using System;

  class MainApp
  {
    static void Main()
    {
      AbstractClass c;
 
      c = new ConcreteClassA();
      c.TemplateMethod();

      c = new ConcreteClassB();
      c.TemplateMethod();

      // Wait for user 
      Console.Read();
    }
  }

  // "AbstractClass"
  abstract class AbstractClass
  {
    public abstract void PrimitiveOperation1();
    public abstract void PrimitiveOperation2();

    // The "Template method" 
    public void TemplateMethod()
    {
      PrimitiveOperation1();
      PrimitiveOperation2();
      Console.WriteLine("");
    }
  }

  // "ConcreteClass" 
  class ConcreteClassA : AbstractClass
  {
    public override void PrimitiveOperation1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClassA.PrimitiveOperation1()");
    }
    public override void PrimitiveOperation2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClassA.PrimitiveOperation2()");
    }
  }

  class ConcreteClassB : AbstractClass
  {
    public override void PrimitiveOperation1()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClassB.PrimitiveOperation1()");
    }
    public override void PrimitiveOperation2()
    {
      Console.WriteLine("ConcreteClassB.PrimitiveOperation2()");
    }
  }
  ```
